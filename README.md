# Real-Estate-Modeling

A multi-linear regression model for optimally pricing houses in King County.

## Description

A complete analysis is ran on King County housing data in order to create a multi-linear regression model which produces the optimal price of a home. The model uses variables such as bedrooms, bathrooms, size, garage, floor count, location, view, condition, grade, and age to evaluate the price of a home. Using training and testing, the final model appears to be very accurate with a min-max accuracy of 98.98%.
